<current_state>
Phase 1 execution started. Plan 01-02 (project scaffolding) is fully complete. Plan 01-01 (Azure provisioning) is paused at Task 2 — a human-action checkpoint waiting for the user to provision Azure resources and populate .env.

Wave 1 was launched with both plans in parallel. 01-02 finished autonomously. 01-01 completed Task 1 (created .env.example and .gitignore) and hit the checkpoint gate.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 01-02: Project Scaffolding & Config Module - COMPLETE (3 commits: 2f94ada, ecfe973, 33efa72)
  - src/__init__.py, src/__main__.py, src/config.py (218 lines with Settings dataclass, layered validation, content filter detection, rich table output)
  - tests/__init__.py, tests/conftest.py, tests/test_config.py (11 passing tests)
  - tests/fixtures/ (chat_completion.json, tool_call_response.json, content_filter_error.json)
  - requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, pyproject.toml
  - .venv created with Python 3.12.10, all deps installed
  - SUMMARY.md created, STATE.md and ROADMAP.md updated
- Plan 01-01 Task 1: Created .env.example and .gitignore (commit: cbcf442)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 01-01 Task 2: User must provision Azure resources and populate .env
  - 8 steps: Create Azure OpenAI resource (East US 2), deploy gpt-4o, create "security-permissive" content filter (High only on all 4 harm categories for input+output), submit content filter modification request, create Sentinel workspace, install Training Lab, copy .env.example to .env and fill in credentials, run az login
  - After user types "done": agent verifies .env has real values, creates 01-01-SUMMARY.md, updates STATE.md and ROADMAP.md
- Phase verification: After both plans complete, verifier agent checks phase goal achievement
- Roadmap update: Mark phase complete if verification passes
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Both plans ran in parallel in Wave 1 (no dependencies between them)
- Plan 01-02 agent auto-fixed: installed Python 3.12.10 via py launcher (only 3.14 was on system), fixed pytest collection conflict with __test__ = False markers, removed unused imports
- Content filter "High only" means setting all 4 harm category sliders (violence, hate, sexual, self-harm) to block only High severity on both input and output filters — most permissive without Microsoft approval
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Azure resource provisioning: User must complete 8 manual steps in Azure Portal / AI Foundry before plan 01-01 can finish
- Content filter modification request approval: 1-3 business days, outside team control. "High only" custom filter is the immediate fallback.
</blockers>

<context>
The execute-phase orchestrator spawned two gsd-executor subagents for Wave 1. Plan 01-02 completed successfully (spot-checked: commits present, SUMMARY.md exists, no self-check failures). Plan 01-01 returned a checkpoint requiring human action.

When resuming, the orchestrator needs to:
1. Spawn a continuation agent for plan 01-01 with the checkpoint state (Task 1 complete, resume at Task 2 with user's response)
2. After 01-01 completes, spot-check its SUMMARY.md
3. Run the phase verifier
4. Update roadmap if verification passes

The user asked for clarification about the content filter — specifically what "High only" means. They were given a detailed explanation with the 10-step AI Foundry walkthrough before pausing.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume execute-phase for phase 1. The orchestrator should detect 01-02 has a SUMMARY.md (skip it) and 01-01 does not (resume it). Present the checkpoint to the user again and wait for "done" to continue the Azure provisioning task.
</next_action>
