<current_state>
Running /gsd:verify-work 2 — Phase 2 UAT verification session.
2 of 7 tests completed (both passed). Test 3 was presented to user but not yet answered.
UAT file: .planning/phases/02-sentinel-data-access/02-UAT.md
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Test 1: Unit Test Suite Passes - PASS (77/77 tests in 2.17s)
- Test 2: Query Incidents from Live Sentinel - PASS (3 incidents returned, 13.8ms, all fields present)
- UAT file created with all 7 tests extracted from 02-01-SUMMARY.md and 02-02-SUMMARY.md
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Test 3: Get Incident Detail by Number - presented, awaiting user response (live run showed it working: incident #1 with 6 alerts, 1 entity, entity_count match)
- Test 4: Query Alerts from Live Sentinel - not started
- Test 5: Get Alert Trend with Auto-Bin - not started
- Test 6: Get Top Entities Ranked by Alert Count - not started
- Test 7: Error Handling — Invalid Time Window - not started
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- .env file was missing at start of session; user recreated it during testing
- Live smoke test (tests/smoke_live.py) is the main command for user to run: `.venv\Scripts\python tests\smoke_live.py`
- Tests extracted from SUMMARY files focus on user-observable outcomes: 1 offline (pytest), 5 live queries, 1 error handling
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None currently. Azure auth (az login) and .env are both working.
</blockers>

<context>
The UAT is straightforward — all live queries are returning valid data from the Sentinel training lab.
Test 3 already ran successfully (incident #1: "Malicious Inbox Rule" with AdeleV entity).
The remaining tests (4-7) should be quick since the smoke test already exercises all 5 methods.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with: /gsd:verify-work 2
This will detect the active UAT session and resume from Test 3 (first pending test).
Present Test 3 checkpoint to user, then continue through Tests 4-7.
</next_action>
